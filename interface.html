<h3>Interface</h3>
<li>
The interface consists of 4*13 small rectangles. 4=number of limbs, 13=stridenum+1.
</li>
<p></p>
<li>Each row represents the time line for a limb, and each column represents a time sample point. Each rectangle, therefore, represents the state for a limb at a specific time sample point: be in swing(red) or be in stance(white).
</li>
<p></p>
<li>The state for every rectangle is changeable by clicking until it is claimed to be a constraint or appendix constraint(then its color would be covered by a purple mask). You could also change a row of states by clicking and moving the mouse cursor.
</li>
<p></p>
<li>We assign values to those rectangles in particular sample points when we add constraints. The rectangles would then be covered by a purple mask and their states are not changeable anymore.
</li>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Appendix Constraint</h3>
<p>There are 3 things about the added constraints that we need to consider.
</p>
<li>If the last constraint state from cycle1 is the starting state of a swing period in cycle1.</li>
<p></p>
<p>Then we need to add an appendix swing constraint after it since a swing period could not have a single time sample point.
</p>
</p><p>
<li>If the first constraint state from cycle2 is the starting state of a swing period in cycle2.
</li>
<p></p>
<p>Then we need to add an appendix stance constraint before it otherwise the constraint value assigned to yPositions in the transition optimization process would be different from that in cycle2.
</p>
<p></p>
<li>If the first constraint state from cycle2 is the end state of a swing period in cycle2.</li>
<p></p>
<p>Then we need to add an appendix swing constraint before it otherwise the swing period would have a single time sample point in the transition process.
